      "Dear friends,\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not easy to find the words to describe my, our state of mind at this moment. We are gathered here in Onna to celebrate the Liberation Day, a celebration that is both an honor and a commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "An honor: to commemorate a terrible massacre that took place right here in June 1944 when the Nazis, in retaliation, killed 17 citizens of Onna and then blew up the house where the bodies of those innocent victims were found.\n",
      "\n",
      "A commitment: what should inspire us is not to forget what happened here and to remember the horrors of totalitarianism and the suppression of 'freedom'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right here, in Abruzzo, the legendary Maiella Brigade was born and operated, decorated with the Gold Medal for Military Valor. In December '43, 15 young people founded what would become the Maiella Brigade, which grew to 1,500 strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no coincidence that on this special day, the soldiers of the Honor Guard standing before us belong to the 33rd Artillery Regiment, the Abruzzesi unit that in 1943 on Cephalonia had the courage to resist the Nazis and sacrifice themselves – fighting – for the honor of our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "To those patriots who fought for the redemption and rebirth of Italy, our admiration, gratitude, and recognition must always go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most Italians today have not experienced what it means to be deprived of freedom. Only the elderly have a direct memory of totalitarianism, foreign occupation, and the war for the liberation of our homeland.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many of us, it is a memory tied to our families, our parents, our grandparents, many of whom were protagonists or victims of those dramatic days. For me, it is the memory of years of separation from my father, forced to emigrate to avoid arrest, the memory of my mother's sacrifices, who alone had to support a large family during those difficult years. It is the memory of her courage, of her, like many others, traveling by train every day from a small town in the province of Como to work in Milan, and on one of those trains, risking her life but managing to save a Jewish woman from the clutches of a Nazi soldier destined for the extermination camps.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the memories, the examples with which we grew up – the memories of a generation of Italians who did not hesitate to choose freedom, even at the risk of their own safety and lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our country owes an inexhaustible debt to those many young people who sacrificed their lives during their most beautiful years to redeem the honor of the nation, out of fidelity to an oath, but above all for that great, splendid, and essential value which is freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "We owe the same debt of gratitude to all those other boys, Americans, English, French, Polish, from the many allied countries, who shed their blood in the Italian campaign. Without them, the sacrifice of our partisans would have risked being in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with respect, we must remember today all the fallen, even those who fought on the wrong side, sincerely sacrificing their lives for their ideals and a lost cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not mean, of course, neutrality or indifference. We are – all free Italians are – on the side of those who fought for our freedom, for our dignity, and for the honor of our homeland.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, the history of the Resistance has been deepened and discussed. It is a good thing that it happened. The Resistance, along with the Risorgimento, is one of the founding values of our nation, a return to the tradition of freedom. And freedom is a right that comes before laws and the state because it is a natural right that belongs to us as human beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a free nation does not need myths. As with the Risorgimento, we must also remember the dark pages of the civil war, even those in which those who fought on the right side made mistakes and took on blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an exercise in truth, in honesty, an exercise that makes the history of those who fought on the right side with selflessness and courage even more glorious.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the history of the many who fought in the Southern army, who, from Cephalonia onwards, redeemed the honor of the uniform with their blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the history of martyrs like Salvo D’Acquisto, who did not hesitate to sacrifice his life in exchange for other innocent lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the history of our soldiers interned in Germany who chose concentration camps rather than collaborating with the Nazis.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the history of the many who hid their fellow Jewish citizens, saving them from deportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above all, it is the history of the many, countless unknown heroes who, with small or great acts of daily courage, contributed to the cause of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the Church, I want to remember, played its part with true courage, to prevent odious concepts like race or religious differences from becoming reasons for persecution and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, we must remember the young Jews of the Jewish Brigade, who came from ghettos all over Europe, took up arms, and fought for freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, many Italians of different faiths, cultures, and backgrounds came together to pursue the same great dream – the dream of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among them were very different individuals and groups. Some thought only of freedom, some dreamed of establishing a different social and political order, some considered themselves bound by an oath of loyalty to the monarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they all managed to set aside their differences, even the most profound ones, to fight together. The communists and the Catholics, the socialists and the liberals, the actionists and the monarchists, faced with a common tragedy, each wrote a great page of our history. A page on which our Constitution is based, a page on which our freedom is based.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the drafting of the Constitution, the wisdom of the political leaders of that time – De Gasperi and Togliatti, Ruini and Terracini, Nenni, Pacciardi, and Parri – managed to channel deep initial divisions towards a single objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although clearly the result of compromises, the republican Constitution achieved two noble and fundamental objectives: guaranteeing freedom and creating the conditions for democratic development in the country. It was not a small feat; in fact, it was the best compromise possible at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the goal of creating a \"common\" moral conscience for the nation was missed, perhaps premature for those times, so much so that the predominant value for everyone was anti-fascism, but not necessarily anti-totalitarianism. It was a product of history, a compromise useful to avoid the Cold War that vertically divided Italy from degenerating into a civil war with unpredictable outcomes. But the assumption of responsibility and the sense of the State that animated all the political leaders of that time remain a great lesson that would be unforgivable to forget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, 64 years after April 25, 1945, and twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, our task, the task of all, is to finally build a unified national sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must do it together, together, regardless of political affiliation, together, for a new beginning of our republican democracy, where all political parties recognize the greatest value, freedom, and debate in its name for the good and the interest of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The anniversary of the regained freedom is, therefore, an opportunity to reflect on the past, but also to reflect on the present and the future of Italy. If we can do it together from today onwards, we will have rendered a great service not to one\n",
      "\n",
      "We have always rejected the idea that our adversary was our enemy. Our religion of freedom demanded it from us and still does. With the same spirit, I am convinced that the time has come for the Liberation Day to become the Day of Freedom, and for this commemoration to shed the character of opposition that revolutionary culture gave it, a character that still 'divides' rather than 'unites'.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say this with great serenity, without any intention of creating controversy. April 25 was the origin of a new season of democracy, and in democracy, the people's vote deserves absolute respect from everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "After April 25, the people peacefully voted for the Republic, and the monarchy accepted the people's judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after, on April 18, 1948, the people's choice was once again decisive for our country: with De Gasperi's victory, the Italian people recognized themselves in the Christian and liberal tradition of their history. The 1950s, always with the support of the popular vote, shaped Italy into a democratic, economic, and social reality. Italy became part of Europe and the West, played a role in promoting Atlantic unity and European unity, transforming from a rejected nation to a respected one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, our young people face other challenges: to defend the freedom conquered by their fathers and expand it even further, aware that without freedom, there can be no peace, justice, or well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these challenges are global and see us engaged alongside free nations: the fight against terrorism, the fight against fanatic and repressive fundamentalism, the fight against racism because freedom, dignity, and peace are rights of every human being, 'everywhere' in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I want to remember the Italian soldiers engaged in peace missions abroad, especially those who have fallen in carrying out this noble mission. There is an ideal continuity between them and all the heroes, Italian and allied, who sacrificed their lives over 60 years ago to give us back freedom, security, and peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the teachings of our fathers take on a special value: this April 25 comes just after the great tragedy that struck this land of Abruzzo. Once again, facing the emergency and tragedy, Italians have shown their ability to unite, to overcome differences, demonstrating that they are a great and cohesive people, full of generosity, solidarity, and courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the many Italians who have been engaged here in rescue and reconstruction efforts, I feel proud, once again, even more so, to be Italian and to lead this wonderful country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, Onna is the symbol of our Italy. The earthquake that destroyed it reminds us of the days when invaders destroyed it. Rebuilding it will mean repeating the gesture of its rebirth after Nazi violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is precisely concerning the heroes of then and today that we all have a great responsibility: to set aside any controversy, to look at the interest of the nation, to safeguard the great heritage of freedom that we inherited from our fathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, we all have the responsibility and duty to build a future of prosperity, security, peace, and freedom for all.\n",
      "\n",
